Students who study science and history develop critical thinking, writing and lab-based skills that are valuable to employers.

But sometimes students need guidance on how to match those skills with the right job, and present those skills to a potential employer.

That’s why SuccessWorks, in the College of Letters & Science, invites students to engage early in the career exploration process.

The College of Letters & Science is home to the largest, most diverse body of students at UW–Madison, with more than 18,000 undergraduates, and SuccessWorks is helping them get an early start on career preparation. Last year, almost 60% of the students who engaged with SuccessWorks were in their first or second year.

“Letters & Science majors provide so many career possibilities,” says Angie White, interim executive director of SuccessWorks. “A Letters & Science degree gives students the critical preparation they need to thrive in a rapidly changing global workplace, teaching them communication, critical thinking, leadership and problem-solving skills, all of which we know employers are seeking.”

SuccessWorks is just one way UW helps students with career planning. Each school or college at UW–Madison has a dedicated career services office with comprehensive career services for students and connections to a vast network of employers. There are around 20 career services offices, including offices that serve all students and alumni regardless of school, college or major.
